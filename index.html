                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                    like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but
                    my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not

                    other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                    and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25

                  <p>Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place. Me and the
                    other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest residential sale in

                    building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it

                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!</p>
